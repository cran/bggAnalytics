#' H-Index
#'
#' Calculate H-Index from the number of game plays. H-Index measures the
#' experience of a player based on reported play counts. It rises only when one
#' plays many different games multiple times. It tries to distinguish players
#' who play a few games really often and these who try every game once and leave
#' it on the shelf from those who have the broad collection of high-count plays.
#'
#' @param num_plays a numeric vector of non-negative integers.
#'
#' @return A single non-negative integer.
